# Coloring Book Plus/Py (README)
The new rendition of the electronic bouldering coloring book (now new and improved code-base because I know a little bit about what I am doing this time).

If you are here to make suggestions to the project. Please put them in the `Issues` tab. Unless you want to format them nicely, don't worry about formatting - I can do that. Just write a couple sentences of the idea you have such that I can understand what you mean and submit it. Thanks!
